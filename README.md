By this vid√©o game project, I am working on different aspect of game design.
The goal is to create a small Online RPG, and by this working in a first place on the networking using PlayFab Azure and Photon.

- Playfab Azure : 
      It will be use to authentificate players by email / username, and to get and set players data and progression.
      
- Photon : 
      Photon will be usefull for the lobby and room system, two different option will be abvailable for the player.
      Either join a random room already creeated by other player, or create/join a friend.
      Remembering the GTA Online session system.
